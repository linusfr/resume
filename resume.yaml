  summary: Hello, my name is Linus, a Site Reliability Engineer from Hamburg. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Applied Computer Science from Flensburg University. During my studies, I interned at Zenner IoT Solutions in Hamburg, where I was introduced to DevOps and automation. As a member of the DevOps team, I managed all VMs and maintained docker swarm setups, utilizing various tools such as Gitlab CI/CD, Ansible, Nginx, and Graylog for logging. I also set up a k3s Kubernetes cluster and wrote my thesis on "Comparing Docker Swarm to Kubernetes in Preparation of Migration Projects." After completing my degree, I continued to work at Zenner IoT Solutions before moving to German Edge Cloud, where I currently work as an SRE, helping development teams deploy with greater frequency and reliability while minimizing service interruptions.

    summary: The German Edge Cloud has two main markets it competes in. Firstly in the cloud, where they have a managed kubernetes offering based on kkp from kubermatic. This in turn utilizes an openstack instance which manages infrastructure over three datacenters which belong to the company. Secondly on the edge, here the company offers an edge enabling customers to self-service VMs on the edge through a management software development by the German Edge Cloud. This is for example used by the Fraunhofer Institute to run compute intensive simulations.
