  summary: >-
    Born and raised in Hamburg, I remained loyal to the north and decided to study Applied Computer Science in Flensburg, which I completed with a Bachelor of Science in 2021.
     During my studies, my focus was on IoT, which is why I interned at Zenner IoT Solutions in Hamburg.
     There, I was introduced to DevOps and automation.
     As a member of the DevOps team, I managed all VMs and maintained Docker Swarm setups, utilizing various tools such as Gitlab CI/CD, Ansible, Nginx, as well as Graylog for logging, alongside many others.
     During my internship, I also set up a k3s Kubernetes cluster, which further piqued my interest in container orchestration.
     This led me to write my thesis on "Comparing Docker Swarm to Kubernetes in Preparation of Migration Projects".
     After completing my bachelor's, I continued to work at Zenner IoT Solutions before joining German Edge Cloud.
     Currently, I work as an SRE, supporting development teams in deploying with greater frequency and reliability while minimizing service interruptions.
     To achieve this, we have developed a deployment setup enabling us to roll out hundreds of applications to dozens of k8s and OpenShift clusters in a Gitops fashion.
     We utilize tools such as ArgoCD, Hashicorp Vault, Gitlab, Renovate, Helm, the Carvel suite, and Bash.
     On a personal level, my passion is surfing, which offers me the best balance between the IT world and nature.

    summary: >-
      I enjoy embracing diverse challenges to keep my work engaging and interesting.
      Starting to freelance has really enabled me to work on different projects, gaining expertise across various contexts.
      I had the chance to work on a greenfield project, crafting new environments from scratch to fit the customer's needs.
      This entailed setting up VMs, a Kubernetes Cluster, and migrating the customer's applications onto both the VMs and the Kubernetes cluster.
      For the migration of the applications, I dockerized and containerized them to work within one of these environments.
      Alongside this, I provided applications such as GitLab, Elasticsearch, and Bitwarden through Kubernetes for the customer.
      Additionally, I developed and maintain the platform for Kubernetes, keeping it updated automatically through the usage of renovate.
      Lastly, I collaborate with developers located across multiple continents, helping them improve their processes by automating their tests and deployments through GitLab Pipelines.
    highlights:
      - Making applications portable by dockerizing and containerizing them
      - Migrating those applications to either fresh VMs or the Kubernetes cluster
      - Provisioning, managing, and updating an rke2 Kubernetes cluster
      - Developing and rolling out a platform for the Kubernetes cluster, utilizing renovate for continuous and automated updates
      - Rolling out applications such as GitLab, Elasticsearch, and Bitwarden onto the Kubernetes cluster for customer usage
      - Collaborating with developers located across multiple continents, helping them improve their processes by automating their tests and deployments through GitLab Pipelines.

    summary: >-
      With both the cloud and the edge, German Edge Cloud competes in two main markets.
      In the cloud, German Edge Cloud provides a managed Kubernetes offering based on kkp from Kubermatic.
      This, in turn, utilizes an OpenStack instance that manages infrastructure across three data centers owned by the company.
      In the edge market, they offer edge services, enabling customers to self-service VMs at the edge through management software developed by German Edge Cloud.
      This is, for example, used by the Fraunhofer Institute to run compute-intensive simulations.
    highlights:
      - Development of a deployment setup for the secure rollout of hundreds of applications to dozens of K8s and Openshift clusters using a GitOps fashion with ArgoCD, HashiCorp Vault, Gitlab, Renovate, Helm, the Carvel suite, and Bash.
      - Monitoring, Logging, and Alerting with Grafana, Alertmanager, Prometheus, Thanos, VictoriaMetrics, OpenSearch, Loki, and Opsgenie.
      - Maintenance of multiple Rancher instances providing cluster access management to the entire company. For this, infrastructure on OpenStack was provisioned through Terraform. On that, RKE clusters are set up and Rancher is rolled out onto the clusters.
      - Automation of repetitive tasks using Golang, Python, Ansible, and Bash.
      - Development of a production readiness review used to engage internal teams in an SRE manner.
      - Engagement with internal development teams utilizing the previously outlined production readiness review, including SLIs and SLOs, enabling the teams to increase the reliability of their respective products.
      - Support for the company's platform on multiple clusters and provision of observability.
      - Management of the operations center, a product used to provision OpenStack resources through a simplified UI on customer edges, working with the OpenStack CLI to manage customer workloads.
      - Incident management, including PMAs.
      - Provisioning of a central ArgoCD used across many teams.
      - Automations using Argo Workflows.
